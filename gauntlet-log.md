## 2026-08-28 overnight, session 1

### TOOL: capture determinism — CERTIFIED (baseline re-pinned on cbfd9cca)
Verdict: green. Not a ledger piece; the visual tripwire could not run at all without it.
- Puppeteer could not launch: the bundled Chrome for Testing is unsigned, macOS refuses to
  exec it (spawn error -88). Every shot in the first sweep printed GAVE UP. launch() now
  falls back to the system Chrome.
- SURPRISE, and the big one: diff.mjs has never been able to go green. The game seeds
  nothing (setSeed is exported but never called), so buildWorld drew a different country
  at every page load and the same build reshot at ssim 0.82 against ITSELF, against a
  0.965 threshold. capture.mjs now splices setSeed in front of the game boot call.
- SURPRISE 2: seeding the global Math.random is NOT enough. three draws 12 randoms per mesh
  for uuids from the same stream, so adding one object shifts every later draw and
  reshuffles the whole world. Seeding the game rng is what makes it immune.
- Noise floor now 0.976 worst, 0 flagged. 10/11/19 pinned for the first time (22 total).
- Pinned on local Chrome 151 / Metal. The old container pins read ~0.78 here for reasons of
  renderer, not content — that is why the whole set was re-pinned rather than judged drifted.

### PIECE: context-aware grunge (Tier 2 item 1) — CERTIFIED 8c6bedf2949e1733609eafd91a2071b6
Verdict: green. Gate CERTIFIED-SHIP, tripwire 22 compared 0 flagged, worst 0.9650 (torch beam).
- SURPRISE: grunge-lite v1 ran BEFORE the road and carpark were laid, so 2 of its 3 wear discs
  were invisible — carpark mouth under the 0.14 tarmac slab, hut door under the 0.46 hut deck.
  Only the campsite disc has ever been seen. 5 of the 26 stones were sunk in the carpark seal,
  one a boulder standing in the middle of the tarmac at vantage 01.
- Fix: block moved after every surface is built and now reads the surface under each spot
  from the scene; wear takes that colour darkened 0.72 and rides 6mm proud of it.
- Stones on a laid surface are skipped; loop tops back up to 26 in the original draw order so
  surviving stones are bit-identical to v1.
- Proof: battery 9 GRUNGE READS THE GROUND. Bite-tested (forcing dirt height names 0,7.5 and
  13,32.5 as buried).
- EYEBALL: gauntlet/capture/01_carpark_wide.png (boulder gone, oil patch at the carpark mouth)
  and 02_hut_snow.png (hut-door wear moved to the foot of the step; subtle under tussock).
